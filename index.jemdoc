== About me
Currently I am a Senior Manager in American Express Company AI Labs, working on the company's Natural Langaue Processing R&D. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from University of Michigan, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department, majoring in [https://www.eecs.umich.edu/eecs/research/area.html?r_id=10 Control Systems], under the guidance of [http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~smm/ Professor Semyon M. Meerkov], in August 2021, and the B.S.E degree from Harbin Institute of Technology ([http://en.hit.edu.cn/ HIT]), China, in 2016. 

== Research
My research interests include: 
- Natural Language Processing,
- Stochastic System Analysis and Control, 
- Application of Probability Theory, 
- Optimization.
